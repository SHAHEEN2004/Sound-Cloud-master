Working with close collaborators and large-scale institutions in tandem, Cooper has developed a mixed-media approach to creation. Whether a walk-through light installations, groundbreaking use of 4D sound, or club-ready techno releases, Cooper’s output is a classic case of electronic exploration that makes use of available technology while referencing that which came before it, and does so in a human way.\n\nWhat now drives the Belfast-born artist as he sets out on a fresh cycle for his fourth studio album Yearning for the Infinite is “a question of communication” – to create a lasting human impression through technology and machinery. The project, which encompasses film and web media as well as Cooper’s typically lush and emotive style, arose through an invitation from The Barbican, asking Cooper to respond to their 2019 theme of “Life Rewired.” On the resultant LP Yearning for the Infinite, he continues to till the fertile land of “big chord progressions and micro-glitch detailing” that captivated listeners across previous albums Human, Emergence and One Hundred Billion Sparks. He then brings this to life via “really impactful storytelling through the medium of abstract visuals and audio,” as in the lineage of Cooper’s key influences Philip Glass and Chris Cunningham.\n\nSynthesising his interests and presenting it in an accessible way that defies conventional format, Cooper explores concepts of perpetual growth, Penrose tiling and parallax perception. It adds up to an immersion of sound, vision and concept that “can totally remove you from your normal experience of reality and put you somewhere new.” At the core, Max Cooper’s mission as a musician, a DJ and an interdisciplinary artist is all about provoking a greater understanding. This is pushed to new depths on Yearning for the Infinite.\n\nWritten by Gabriel Szatan",

      "description": "AL002 - Vaal - Wander To Hell \n\nGet your copy here: http://bit.ly/beatport_AL002\nhttp://bit.ly/spotify_AL002\n\nVinyl:\nhttp://bit.ly/mtn_AL002\n\nThe next instalment on Afterlife comes from Vaal with remixes by Locked Groove and Baikal. ’Wander To Hell’ is a three track EP, with three versions of the same track that each encapsulate the spirit of Afterlife in their own individual way.\n\nHeralding from a rock n’roll and jazz background Vaal is unperturbed by the strict rules that define & guard electronic music. ‘Wander To Hell’ is stripped back and gentle, highlighting the emotive side of the label. The combination of alluring vocals and beautiful reverberating chords along with the ebb and flow of distortion makes it a composition that grips the listener from start to finish.\nBelgian talent Locked Groove seeks the dancefloor with his remix. He brings back a little familiarity, the vocal remains, but is now present amongst an assortment of synths and percussion, pushing through to darker, heavier depths.\nBaikal makes multi layered electronic music simultaneously for the heart, mind and feet. His version of ‘Wander To Hell’ is truly spellbinding, featuring a hypnotic groove that glides seamlessly through a continuum of time and space.",

      "description": "Buy Emergence: http://maxcooper.lnk.to/Emergence\n\nI started this track with a simple Prophet patch running through a Moog ring mod with loads of overdrive. It wasn't so much overdrive that it became aggressive, but enough so that it had a simple tonal quality overlaid with plenty of honest low-fi grittyness. Sometimes all it takes is getting that first timbral feature right for the rest of the track to flow from there, and this was a good example for me. \n\nI also knew I wanted the track to fit later on in the Emergence story, where it should be rhythmically straight enough to fit into a club show where needed, but also for the part of the show where we explore visually, the range of complex living forms and evolutionary change - it needed to capture some of that beauty of life's morphogenetic creativity.\n\nI found the chord sequence fairly quickly, and built the drums and smooth dynamics within a few days, but I got stuck on how to complete the track. I tried hundreds of different ideas, and thought I might need to bin the project, but then luckily stumbled across some old synth jam recordings that had some moments that sounded ok. So I jumped on those and went to work on an editing job. \n\nIt turned out that a lot of the problem I had been having was that I was trying to add too much, when for me, the chords were the hook, and what was needed was a sparse melodic addition to support the chords rather than any sort of traditional tuneful hook. In recent years I've been more and more drawn to just chord sequences as the main features of tracks musically, with the rest stripped away. When Ryan Rival Consoles was considering a remix he commented the album seemed to be all about the chords (or something to that extent), so I guess that idea is in there. Chords just seem to carry the most emotion for me for some reason (as opposed to melodies or lyrics for example).\n\nSo there it is, I hope you like the track!",

Working with close collaborators and large-scale institutions in tandem, Cooper has developed a mixed-media approach to creation. Whether a walk-through light installations, groundbreaking use of 4D sound, or club-ready techno releases, Cooper’s output is a classic case of electronic exploration that makes use of available technology while referencing that which came before it, and does so in a human way.\n\nWhat now drives the Belfast-born artist as he sets out on a fresh cycle for his fourth studio album Yearning for the Infinite is “a question of communication” – to create a lasting human impression through technology and machinery. The project, which encompasses film and web media as well as Cooper’s typically lush and emotive style, arose through an invitation from The Barbican, asking Cooper to respond to their 2019 theme of “Life Rewired.” On the resultant LP Yearning for the Infinite, he continues to till the fertile land of “big chord progressions and micro-glitch detailing” that captivated listeners across previous albums Human, Emergence and One Hundred Billion Sparks. He then brings this to life via “really impactful storytelling through the medium of abstract visuals and audio,” as in the lineage of Cooper’s key influences Philip Glass and Chris Cunningham.\n\nSynthesising his interests and presenting it in an accessible way that defies conventional format, Cooper explores concepts of perpetual growth, Penrose tiling and parallax perception. It adds up to an immersion of sound, vision and concept that “can totally remove you from your normal experience of reality and put you somewhere new.” At the core, Max Cooper’s mission as a musician, a DJ and an interdisciplinary artist is all about provoking a greater understanding. This is pushed to new depths on Yearning for the Infinite.\n\nWritten by Gabriel Szatan",

I came back to it again and again – it seemed to work in clubs but also as a sneaky, immersive headphone listen. I love the feel of an almost overwhelming percussive violence being suddenly flooded with heartache and melody. I find that dynamic exhilarating.\n\nI really wanted this E.P. to capture that. I hope you enjoy listening to it!”\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/throttleclark\nhttps://twitter.com/throttleclark",
